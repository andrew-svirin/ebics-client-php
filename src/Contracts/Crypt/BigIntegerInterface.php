     * @internal The most naive approach to modular exponentiation has very unreasonable requirements, and
     *    and although the approach involving repeated squaring does vastly better, it, too, is impractical
     *    for our purposes.  The reason being that division - by far the most complicated and time-consuming
     *    of the basic operations (eg. +,-,*,/) - occurs multiple times within it.
     *
     *    Modular reductions resolve this issue.  Although an individual modular reduction takes more time
     *    then an individual division, when performed in succession (with the same modulo), they're a lot faster.
     *
     *    The two most commonly used modular reductions are Barrett and Montgomery reduction.  Montgomery reduction,
     *    although faster, only works when the gcd of the modulo and of the base being used is 1.  In RSA, when the
     *    base is a power of two, the modulo - a product of two primes - is always going to have a gcd of 1 (because
     *    the product of two odd numbers is odd), but what about when RSA isn't used?
     *
     *    In contrast, Barrett reduction has no such constraint.  As such, some bigint implementations perform a
     *    Barrett reduction after every operation in the modpow function.  Others perform Barrett reductions when the
     *    modulo is even and Montgomery reductions when the modulo is odd.  BigInteger.java's modPow method, however,
     *    uses a trick involving the Chinese Remainder Theorem to factor the even modulo into two numbers - one odd and
     *    the other, a power of two - and recombine them, later.  This is the method that this modPow function uses.
     *    {@link http://islab.oregonstate.edu/papers/j34monex.pdf Montgomery Reduction with Even Modulus} elaborates.
